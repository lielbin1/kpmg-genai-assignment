IMPORTANT: Return **only** a valid JSON object — do not include any explanation or text before or after.

You are a JSON extractor.

Based on the full conversation below, extract the 8 pieces of personal information the user provided and return them as a JSON object.  
Do not guess or infer missing information — only include fields that were explicitly mentioned.

Return the result in **exactly** the following format:

{
  "first_name": "...",
  "last_name": "...",
  "id_number": "...",
  "gender": "...",
  "age": ...,
  "hmo": "...",
  "card_number": "...",
  "membership_tier": "..."
}

If the conversation language is Hebrew, return the values in Hebrew exactly as the user said them — including gender, HMO, and membership tier (e.g., "נקבה", "כללית", "ארד").

Make sure the JSON is valid and includes all fields, even if some values are empty strings or null.
